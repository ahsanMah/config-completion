\section{Conclusion}
Compared to software developers, network operators are often left neglected when it comes to development tools. Our work tries to bridge that gap by providing a simple completion engine that could be incorporated into a more extensive tool. Our initial findings show that we can get fairly respectable accuracies with off-the-shelf NLP techniques. However, we propose a myriad of refinements to the model that could potentially improve our accuracies to desirable numbers.
