In this thesis, we state the need for an auto-completion engine for writing network configurations. The tools and technology available today allow for synthesizing configurations in large batches or verifying existing configurations. We wish to target the middle of the development life-cycle, to help network operators as they create new configurations or edit existing ones. We propose a simple, yet powerful model inspired by code completion techniques and NLP research. We perform various evaluations which show that the current state of the model gives encouraging results, but also, challenge some of our assumptions about network configurations. We also outline additional work that is required to tune our model specifically for network configurations before we can truly realize our goal. Once completed, we believe our engine will be a strong first step in creating a holistic tool similar to IDEs that can assist network operators.
